      "description": "Core Concepts\nAI Card Studio is a powerful workflow management platform that transforms your interactions with AI into structured, reusable processes through an intuitive card-based interface. It organizes work into visual 'columns' on a 'canvas,' where each card plays a specific role, creating a systematic approach for complex tasks.\n\nKey Features\nVisual Workspace: Supports creating multiple canvases to organize different projects or contexts. Workflows are organized into logical sequences of columns, with a drag-and-drop interface for easy card rearrangement and organization.\n\nCard Types: Projects include two core card types.\nInformation Cards: Used to store important information, reference materials, and context. They support adding titles, descriptions, and detailed notes, making them perfect for project overviews or research findings.\nAI Tool Cards: Used to interact with AI models, allowing for custom prompts.\nSmart Reference System: The core advantage of AI Card Studio lies in its powerful inter-card reference mechanism. You can use [REF: Card Name] in AI Tool Cards to reference the output of preceding AI cards, forming a one-way, ordered data flow. This smart referencing ensures that each step in the workflow automatically gets the results from the previous step, enabling true data flow and context passing. Additionally, you can use [INFO: Info Title] to reference content from Information Cards, enabling an input mechanism where users enter raw data (e.g., questions, materials, parameters) into an Information Card, and AI Tool Cards automatically reference this content, avoiding redundant input.\n\nDynamic Option Configuration:\n1. Configuration: Set an `options` array in an AI Tool Card, e.g., [\"Daily Life\", \"Business Situations\", \"Academic Writing\"].\n2. Placeholder Usage: Use the fixed placeholder `{{option}}` in the prompt (note: only the exact keyword 'option' is supported).\n3. Interaction Flow:\n   - User clicks the execute button.\n   - If the card has options configured, the system automatically pops up an options panel.\n   - The user selects a value from the preset options.\n   - The system replaces `{{option}}` with the user's selected value.\n   - The complete prompt is sent to the AI model.\n4. Practical Effect: With a single 'Content Generator' card configured with [\"Email Reply\", \"Social Media\", \"Technical Document\"] options, if a user selects 'Email Reply,' `{{option}}` is replaced by 'Email Reply,' and the AI generates content in the corresponding style.\n\n  Key Takeaways:\n  - Only a single `{{option}}` placeholder is supported (no multiple custom variable names).\n  - The `options` array is a string array, with each item being a selectable preset value.\n  - This allows one card template to adapt to multiple use cases.\n\nCommunity Marketplace: This feature allows users to upload and share their successful workflow structures. You can also browse and import community-created templates into your workspace with a single click.\n\nData Management: Supports importing/exporting a single column or an entire workflow. Workflows are saved in JSON format, making them easy to share and back up. It also provides smart duplicate detection and version control.\n\nAdvanced Automation Features\n\nSupports Webhook integration and external service connections to automatically push AI-generated content to your business systems. For example, you can automatically send generated marketing copy to social media platforms, push analysis reports to Slack channels, or sync processed data to a CRM system. Through automation platforms like n8n, you can achieve even more complex workflow orchestration, such as triggering AI processing based on specific events, automatically archiving results to cloud storage, or triggering subsequent business processes based on AI output, truly achieving end-to-end automation from AI generation to business execution.",

This goal can be broken down into several sub-goals, which must provide a full, valuable, and meaningful breakdown of the core goal (do not break down goals for the sake of it). The total number of sub-goals should not exceed 6.\nNote: Your task is not to design the card arrangement. You should focus on combining the capabilities of AI Card Studio to establish scientific, valuable, meaningful, and genuinely problem-solving workflow goals and sub-goals.\nDo not include any other content.\n",
      "generatedContent": "1. **Scenario Refinement**:  \nJob seekers often need to customize their work experience section for each job application based on the specific Job Description (JD) to highlight the most relevant skills and achievements. However, manually analyzing each JD, matching their own experience, and rephrasing the content is not only time-consuming but also prone to missing key points or using imprecise language, resulting in a low resume-to-job match and missed interview opportunities.\n\n2. **Workflow Goals**:  \nCore Goal: To help job seekers quickly and accurately tailor the work experience section of their resumes based on the Job Description, thereby improving the resume's match and competitiveness.\n\nSub-goals:\n- Parse the Job Description and automatically extract key skills, responsibilities, and preferred qualifications.\n- Match the user's raw work experience input to identify entries relevant to the JD.\n- Optimize the work experience descriptions based on the JD's context, using more relevant professional terminology and expressions.\n- Generate multiple versions of the tailored content in different styles for the user to choose from or further adjust.\n- Ensure the output content is well-structured, highlights key points, and maintains a natural, professional tone.\n- Support batch processing of multiple JDs to increase the efficiency of mass applications."

Strictly avoid designing features beyond the scope of AI Card Studio's functionality. Detail which **Information Cards** and **AI Tool Cards** should be placed in this column:\nA- The top of the column (the first Card) must be an **Information Card**. Its title should be concise and represent the entire column.

The title should briefly represent the stage, and the description should briefly explain the function and usage of this stage.\nC- If an **Information Card** will be referenced by a subsequent **AI Tool Card**, it's best to add a reminder card above it to explain that the next card requires manual input and that this card is only a reminder, so the user always understands the flow.\nD- The prompts for **AI Tool Cards** must be professional and follow best practices (each prompt must explicitly ask the large model to return content in Markdown format). Also, ensure the correctness and logical clarity of smart references and dynamic options.\nE- All titles (for Information Cards) and button labels (for AI Tool Cards) must be in English.

Correct Type: Must be either `\"info\"` or `\"aitool\"`.\n\n  Field Validation Checklist\n\n  - ✅ Each card has a unique `id`.\n  - ✅ Info cards include `title` and `description`.\n  - ✅ AI tool cards include `buttonName`, `promptText`, `aiModel`, and `generatedContent`.\n  - ✅ `aiModel` can only be `\"deepseek\"` or `\"openai\"`.\n  - ✅ All `generatedContent` fields are set to an empty string `\"\"`.\n\n  Reference System Rules\n\n  - ✅ The `Button Name` in `[REF: Button Name]` must exactly match the `buttonName` of an AI tool card.\n  - ✅ The `Title` in `[INFO: Title]` must exactly match the `title` of an info card.\n  - ✅ The target card being referenced must be defined before the current card (one-way reference).\n  - ✅ The `{{option}}` placeholder for dynamic options must be used in conjunction with the `options` array.\n\n  User Input Design Specification\n\n  - ✅ User input should be collected in the `description` of an info card.\n  - ✅ AI tool cards reference user input via `[INFO: Card Title]`.\n  - ❌ Do not expect users to manually enter content directly into the AI prompt.\n  - ✅ Design clear input prompts telling users where to input what content.\n\n  🎯 Generation Requirements\n\n  1. Fully generate the workflow based on my specific requirements.\n  2. Ensure all reference relationships are correct, with referenced cards coming before the current card.\n  3. The JSON format must be perfectly correct and directly parsable.\n  4. The functional logic must be complete, forming a meaningful workflow chain.\n  5. Reasonably set up user input collection points (info cards).\n  6. Only output the JSON code, no additional explanations.\n\nPlease strictly follow the above specifications to generate the JSON file, ensuring it is 100% usable upon import!"
