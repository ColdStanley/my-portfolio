AI Card Studio - Project Overview
==========================================

AI Card Studio is a powerful workflow management platform that transforms AI interactions into structured, reusable processes through an intuitive card-based interface.

## Core Concept

Instead of repetitive one-off AI conversations, AI Card Studio organizes your work into visual "canvases" containing "columns" of interconnected cards. Each card serves a specific purpose in your workflow, creating a systematic approach to complex tasks.

## Main Features

### 1. Visual Workspace Management
- **Multiple Canvases**: Create separate workspaces for different projects or contexts
- **Column-Based Organization**: Structure your workflow into logical sequences
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Easily rearrange and organize your cards
- **Real-time Auto-save**: Your work is automatically preserved as you build

### 2. Two Types of Cards

**Info Cards:**
- Store important information, references, and context
- Add titles, descriptions, and detailed notes
- Perfect for project briefs, requirements, or research findings

**AI Tool Cards:**
- Interactive cards that communicate with AI models
- Customize prompts for specific tasks
- Support for multiple AI providers (OpenAI, DeepSeek)
- Generate content directly within your workflow

### 3. AI Integration
- **Multiple AI Models**: Choose between different AI providers for each card
- **Custom Prompts**: Tailor AI instructions for your specific use cases
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time AI output display
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain conversation flow across your workflow

### 4. Marketplace (Community Features)
- **Share Workflows**: Upload your successful column structures for others to use
- **Discover Templates**: Browse community-created workflows and tools
- **Import & Adapt**: One-click import of useful workflows into your workspace
- **Search & Filter**: Find workflows by category, tags, or popularity

### 5. Data Management
- **Import/Export**: Share individual columns or entire workflows
- **JSON Format**: Standard format for easy sharing and backup
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Smart detection prevents accidental re-uploads
- **Version Control**: Track changes and maintain workflow integrity

## User Workflow Example

1. **Create a Canvas** for your project (e.g., "Content Marketing Campaign")
2. **Add a Column** to organize related tasks (e.g., "Blog Post Creation")
3. **Start with Info Cards** to define requirements and context
4. **Add AI Tool Cards** for content generation, editing, and optimization
5. **Execute your workflow** step by step through the cards
6. **Share successful workflows** to the marketplace for others to benefit

## Who Can Benefit

- **Content Creators**: Streamline writing, editing, and publishing processes
- **Researchers**: Organize analysis workflows and documentation
- **Marketers**: Create systematic campaign development processes
- **Students**: Structure learning and project workflows
- **Professionals**: Build repeatable processes for common tasks

## Key Advantages

- **Reusability**: Build once, use many times
- **Systematic Approach**: Reduces the chaos of ad-hoc AI interactions
- **Community Learning**: Benefit from others' proven workflows
- **Flexibility**: Adapt and modify workflows for different contexts
- **Visual Clarity**: See your entire process at a glance

## Getting Started

1. Visit the AI Card Studio workspace
2. Create your first canvas
3. Add columns to organize your workflow
4. Start with simple info cards to outline your process
5. Add AI tool cards for automated tasks
6. Execute your workflow and refine as needed
7. Share successful workflows with the community

AI Card Studio transforms scattered AI conversations into structured, repeatable, and shareable workflows - making you more productive and systematic in your AI-assisted work.
